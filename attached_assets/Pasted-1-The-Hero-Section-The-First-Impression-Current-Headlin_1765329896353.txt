1. The Hero Section (The "First Impression")Current:Headline: "More Leads, More Sales, Done For You"Subhead: "Set it and forget it with our fully automated sales system..."Visual: A laptop showing... wireframes (empty boxes).The Critique:The Headline is invisible. Every agency on earth promises "More Leads." A Dealer Principal scans right past this.The Visual is a deal-killer. Showing a laptop with empty grey boxes subconsciously tells the dealer: "This software isn't finished." It looks like a mockup, not a product.The "AI" Pitch is weak. "Books the appointments with AI" is passive.The Fix (Design & Copy):New Headline: "Your Inventory Is Burning Cash. Let AI Turn It Into Profit 24/7."Why: It attacks their fear (holding costs) and offers a solution (profit).New Subhead: "Stop letting leads die in your CRM. LotView engages every lead, answers every question, and books firm appointments while your BDC is asleep."Visual Fix: You must replace that laptop screen with a high-fidelity UI mock.Show a chat window of the AI closing a deal on a Ford F-150.Show a dashboard with a green graph going UP.It needs to look complex enough to be valuable, but simple enough to understand in 1 second.2. The Features GridCurrent:Headline: "Everything You Need to Sell More Cars"Copy: "Zero-Touch Inventory Sync," "Market Analysis Tool."The Critique:This reads like a feature list for a developer, not a benefit list for a General Manager. A GM doesn't care about "Zero-Touch Sync"; they care about not paying a lot attendant to upload photos.The Fix (Punchy Copy):Zero-Touch Sync $\rightarrow$ "We Sync With Your DMS. You Do Nothing."Copy: "Direct integration with [PBS/CDK/vAuto]. No manual uploads. No stale listings. If it’s on your lot, it’s online."Dominate Facebook Marketplace $\rightarrow$ "Hijack Facebook Traffic Automatically."Copy: "We post your entire inventory to Marketplace daily. When a car sells, we pull it down. Zero admin work."AI Trained on Messages $\rightarrow$ "The BDC Rep That Never Quits."Copy: "Our AI handles objections, negotiates trade-ins within your parameters, and gets them into the showroom."3. The Pricing Section (The Anchor)Current:Headline: "Costs Less Than One Sold Car"The Critique:This is your best line. Keep this. It anchors the price perfectly.However, the pricing tiers ($1,999 and $3,999) are high for a blind signup.Design Fix: The "Contact Sales" button on the Custom plan looks weak compared to the "Start Selling" buttons. It should be "Book Executive Demo."4. Design & Aesthetics (The "Vibe" Check)You mentioned you need better design. Right now, it looks like a standard Bootstrap template.To sell to dealers, you need to look like a "Bank Vault" meets "Apple."Dark Mode / High Contrast: Dealers associate "dark mode" dashboards with high-end financial tech (like Bloomberg terminals). Switch the Hero section to a deep navy background (which you have) but make the UI screenshots pop with bright neon accents (green for money/sales, blue for AI).Trust Logos: You are missing the most critical element.Right under the Hero button, add a grayscale strip: "Integrates seamlessly with:"Logos: CDK Global, Reynolds & Reynolds, PBS, vAuto, Cox Automotive.Why: If they don't see these logos, they assume you will break their workflow.
