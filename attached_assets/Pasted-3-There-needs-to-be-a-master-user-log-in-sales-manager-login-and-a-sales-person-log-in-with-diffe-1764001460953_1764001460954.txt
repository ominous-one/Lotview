3. There needs to be a master user log-in, sales manager login, and a sales person log-in with different account access. 
3a. The master user can adjust the settings here (credit score needed for certain interest rates, which model years can get approved for certain terms (example, a 2017 cant get approved on 84 months but a 2022 can). Then, be able to connect all the webhooks, including post webhook to PBS. Then, the ability to set-up[ the different prompts, see all in progress conversations like a master dashboard, have ai analyze all the different conversations in each cta and then analyze it and learn from it, as well as offer suggestions to improve the prompts. Make sure the chats are actually visible. 
 Also see all other account access. Also, the master user can select which vehicles that have the remarketing set-up for. They can select up to 20 vehicles that will have remarketing set-up for and can prioritize the budget. 
3b. A sales person connects their facebook accounts, where they can connect up to 5 facebook accounts. For each facebook account, they preselect a template where they can input dynamicVariables into the facebook marketplace ad templates. After saving the template, they can see all the vehicles from the inventory grid that is broken down into year, make, model, and dealership its located at. They select the order in which it will post (1,2…45). The visual they can see is the facebook page connections (max 5), after clicking on it, it shows information underneath it for which vehicles to post, and the template with the dynamic variables. At the bottom of the list, there is the template copy that they can edit. When they click on one of the vehicles in the list, a drop down shows the filled out template for their review. Any leads that come through the facebook pages, it is connected to the ghl ai that will nurture the lead, follow-up with them, and just handle all incoming leads. It needs to be connected to all the pages for all the sales guys so will need to be authenticated somehow to connect to facebook marketplace and facebook pages.  
Also, they can choose a time buffer between posts, and the starting time. Example, start at 9am and be 3 hours between posts. 

3c. The sales manager can see a price comparison tool. For example, this will replace Vauto. The sales manager can input a vin, it will decode it down to year, make, model, trim, find all similar vehicles within a selectable distance (100km, 250km, 500km, 1000km, national) and be able to select additional years and additional trims, just like Autotrader. It also needs to tell me hopw long its been in stock (maybe carguru is better for data). This needs to be executed only when the manager clicks enter.
