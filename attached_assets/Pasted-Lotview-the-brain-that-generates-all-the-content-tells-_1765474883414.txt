Lotview = the brain that generates all the content + tells staff what to post.
Staff = the hands that actually click “Post” inside Facebook/Marketplace.

No bots, no API posting, just world-class assist.

I’ll break it down into very concrete steps:

0. Architecture in one picture

Flow per vehicle:

Vehicle lands in Lotview (scraper / DMS / CSV → DB).

Lotview calls AI → generates copy for Marketplace / Page posts / IG / replies.

That copy is saved in your DB.

In the UI, reps see a “Today’s vehicles to post” board.

They click Copy (or “Copy all”) → Lotview puts the text on their clipboard.

They go to Facebook (Marketplace / Page) and paste → tweak → Publish.

They click “Mark as posted” back in Lotview for tracking.

Optionally later: Chrome extension that fills the Marketplace form fields when they click a button, but still leaves “Publish” to them.

1. Data model you need

You probably already have vehicles. Add tables (or columns) for content and posting state.

1. Vehicles

Minimal:

// vehicles
id: string
dealer_id: string
stock_number: string
vin: string
year: number
make: string
model: string
trim: string | null
price: number | null
kilometers: number | null
body_style: string | null
drive_type: string | null
transmission: string | null
exterior_color: string | null
images: string[]  // array JSON in postgres
days_in_stock: number
priority_score: number   // your scoring (aged, margin, etc.)
created_at: Date
updated_at: Date


2. Social content per vehicle

// social_content
id: string
vehicle_id: string (FK -> vehicles.id)
channel: "MARKETPLACE" | "PAGE_POST" | "INSTAGRAM" | "REPLY_TEMPLATE"
title: string | null       // used for Marketplace / Page posts
body: string               // main text
hashtags: string | null    // e.g. "#hyundaicanada #vancouvercars"
cta_hint: string | null    // "DM us 'TUCSON' for more info"
version: number            // for regenerations
generated_at: Date


You can either:

Store one row per channel, or

Store one JSON blob per vehicle with all texts inside.

JSON option:

// vehicles.social_templates JSON
{
  "marketplace": { "title": "...", "body": "...", "hashtags": "..." },
  "page_post": { "body": "...", "hashtags": "..." },
  "instagram": { "caption": "...", "hashtags": "..." },
  "reply": { "first_message": "...", "followup": "..." }
}


3. Posting tracker (optional but nice)

// social_posting_log
id: string
vehicle_id: string
user_id: string         // sales rep
channel: "MARKETPLACE" | "PAGE" | "INSTAGRAM"
posted_at: Date
notes: string | null    // e.g. "Posted to personal profile in 3 groups"


Then you can show “✅ Posted to Marketplace yesterday by John” in the UI.

2. AI content generation pipeline
2.1. Trigger

Options:

Cron job every X minutes: find all vehicles where:

social_templates is null OR

updated_at > templates.generated_at

Or a queue/event: when a new vehicle comes in, push a job “GenerateSocialTemplates(vehicle_id)”.

2.2. Prompt design

You want structured JSON back, not raw prose, so you can directly store it.

Example prompt (pseudo):

You are a copywriter for Canadian car dealerships.
I will give you details about a vehicle and dealership.
Return SHORT, punchy copy for 4 use cases:

Facebook Marketplace listing (title + description)

Facebook Page post (body only)

Instagram caption (body + hashtags)

First reply message when someone asks “Is this available?”

Requirements:

Be clear, honest, and compliant with Canadian car advertising norms.

Don’t mention financing rates or approvals; focus on condition, history, and value.

Keep tone professional but friendly.

Return valid JSON ONLY in this format:

{
  "marketplace": { "title": "...", "body": "..." },
  "page_post": { "body": "..." },
  "instagram": { "caption": "...", "hashtags": "..." },
  "reply": { "message": "..." }
}


VEHICLE:

Year: {{year}}

Make: {{make}}

Model: {{model}}

Trim: {{trim}}

KMs: {{kms}}

Price: ${{price}}

Location: {{dealer_city}}, {{dealer_province}}

Notes: {{if one-owner, clean Carfax, etc.}}

DEALER:

Name: {{dealer_name}}

Main value props: {{e.g. “family-owned, no doc fee surprises, 4.9★ Google rating”}}

You call the LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc.), parse JSON, validate lengths, then save to social_templates.

2.3. Regeneration

In the UI, add a “Regenerate copy” button per vehicle:

Call AI again with updated notes (e.g., new promo).

Increment version.

Log who requested the regen (for audit).

3. Lotview UI – “Today’s Social Queue”

Think of a page like:

/social → Social Playbook

3.1. Top-level layout

Filters:

Rooftop

Channel (Marketplace / Page / IG)

Days in stock (“Aged 45+ days first”)

Sort:

Priority score, price, date added.

Then show a card list of vehicles:

Each card shows:

Main photo

Year / Make / Model / Trim

Price & KM

Days in stock, priority tag

Badges like “✅ Posted to Marketplace yesterday” if you use the posting log

And then channel buttons:

Copy Marketplace

Copy Page Post

Copy IG Caption

View Reply Script

Clicking a button:

Copies the right text to clipboard

Shows a toast “Copied Marketplace listing for 2023 Tucson Preferred”.

3.2. “Copy all” UX

Inside the card, you can also have:

A “Preview & Copy All” modal:

Tabs: Marketplace / Page / IG / Replies

At bottom, a big Copy to Clipboard button for whichever tab is active.

3.3. React copy implementation (concrete code)

You can build a reusable CopyButton component.

import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Check, Copy } from "lucide-react";
import { toast } from "sonner";

interface CopyButtonProps {
  text: string;
  label?: string;
}

export function CopyButton({ text, label = "Copy" }: CopyButtonProps) {
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false);

  const handleCopy = async () => {
    try {
      if (navigator.clipboard && window.isSecureContext) {
        await navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
      } else {
        // Fallback for older browsers
        const textarea = document.createElement("textarea");
        textarea.value = text;
        textarea.style.position = "fixed";
        textarea.style.left = "-9999px";
        document.body.appendChild(textarea);
        textarea.select();
        document.execCommand("copy");
        document.body.removeChild(textarea);
      }

      setCopied(true);
      toast.success("Copied to clipboard");
      setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 1800);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Copy failed", err);
      toast.error("Unable to copy. Please copy manually.");
    }
  };

  return (
    <Button
      type="button"
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      className="rounded-full text-xs"
      onClick={handleCopy}
    >
      {copied ? (
        <>
          <Check className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
          Copied
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <Copy className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
          {label}
        </>
      )}
    </Button>
  );
}


Usage inside a vehicle card:

<CopyButton
  label="Copy Marketplace"
  text={`${templates.marketplace.title}\n\n${templates.marketplace.body}`}
/>

<CopyButton
  label="Copy Page Post"
  text={templates.page_post.body}
/>

<CopyButton
  label="Copy IG Caption"
  text={`${templates.instagram.caption}\n\n${templates.instagram.hashtags}`}
/>

4. Staff workflow: how reps will actually use it

This is important so it feels like “almost autopost” to them:

Start of shift

Rep logs into Lotview → goes to Social Playbook.

Filters by their rooftop & channel (e.g., “Marketplace today”).

For each vehicle:

Clicks the vehicle card → sees the recommended copy + main photos.

Clicks Copy Marketplace.

Switches to Facebook → Marketplace → “Create listing → Vehicles”.

Pastes the title & description, uploads photos (you can list which photos to use).

Tweaks if needed → clicks Publish.

Back in Lotview

Clicks “Mark as posted to Marketplace”.

Your app records social_posting_log entry (vehicle, user, channel, timestamp).

End result

Manager can see: “John posted 7 units to Marketplace this morning; here are the stock numbers and timestamps.”

You can also add:

A progress bar at the top:

“You’ve posted 3 / 10 recommended units today.”

5. Optional: helper browser extension (slightly more advanced)

This is 100% optional, but it can make it feel like magic.

Goal: When a rep is on the “Create Marketplace listing” page, they can click your Chrome extension → choose the vehicle → it fills in title/description for them.

Still:

User opened Facebook themselves

User installed the extension

User clicks the button & reviews text

User still clicks Publish

5.1. High-level design

Chrome extension (Manifest v3) with:

A popup UI (search by stock # or VIN).

A content script that can read/write form fields on Facebook.

Secure API endpoint in Lotview:

GET /api/social-template?stock=ABC123

Returns the JSON templates for that user/dealer.

5.2. Minimal flow

Rep opens Facebook → Marketplace → “Create listing (vehicle)”.

Clicks the Lotview Chrome extension icon.

Types stock number or VIN (or sees a dropdown of “today’s priority cars”).

Extension fetches from your API:

{
  "marketplace": {
    "title": "2022 Hyundai Tucson Preferred AWD | One Owner | No Accidents",
    "body": "Clean Carfax, heated seats, blind spot, ...",
    "hashtags": "#hyundaicanada #vancouvercars"
  }
}


Content script runs something like:

// VERY simplified example, you'd need real selectors:
document.querySelector('input[name="title"]').value = data.marketplace.title;
document.querySelector('textarea[name="description"]').value =
  data.marketplace.body + "\n\n" + data.marketplace.hashtags;


Rep reviews the listing, adds photos, and clicks Publish.

Important:
You have to treat this as a local assist tool, not a hidden bot. No automatic posting, no background spam. Everything happens because the rep:

Opened the page

Clicked your icon

Chose the vehicle

Clicked Publish

6. Guardrails & compliance

To stay aligned with what you already told Meta:

“Clients stay in full control and publish posts themselves from their own accounts; we do not log in or post on their behalf.”

Make sure:

Lotview never handles Facebook logins

No “Connect your Facebook” login flow for this feature.

You’re just generating text.

No automation without user presence

Don’t schedule background scripts that fire off posts.

Don’t auto-fill forms behind the scenes.

Clear language in your UI

“Step 1: Copy this text.
Step 2: Paste into Marketplace / your Page.
Step 3: Mark as posted.”

Internal note in your docs

“This feature is assistive only. All posting is done manually by staff. Lotview never uses scripts or bots to log in or publish.”

7. Concrete next steps (for you this week)

If you want to actually ship v1:

Add social_templates JSON column to vehicles.

Create a small “Generate templates” script that:

Pulls 5 test vehicles

Calls your AI of choice with the prompt above

Stores the templates JSON.

Build a simple /social page in your existing Replit app:

List vehicles with social_templates IS NOT NULL

Add the CopyButton component for:

Marketplace

Page post

IG caption

Sit with 1–2 salespeople and watch them:

Use Lotview

Go to Facebook

Paste + post

Note the friction → adjust copy length / structure.

Once that’s live and smooth, we can design v2 with:

Better scoring / sorting (“Top 10 to post today”)

Posting log + KPI dashboard

Extension mock for later.
