Complete Setup & Publishing Guide
Part 1: Making All API Key Settings Work
Current Status
The API key management system exists in the SuperAdmin Dashboard under the Integrations tab. However, there are a few things that need to be verified and wired up properly:

Integration	Status	What's Needed
OpenAI	✅ Working	Using Replit's built-in integration
GHL	⚠️ Partial	Keys can be saved, but chat sync needs wiring
MarketCheck	⚠️ Partial	Key can be saved, needs to use from database
Apify	⚠️ Partial	Keys can be saved, needs to use from database
Gemini	❌ Not wired	Key field exists, no backend usage yet
Facebook App	⚠️ Partial	Keys work for posting feature
GA4/GTM/Google Ads	✅ Working	Tracking codes inject properly
Facebook Pixel	✅ Working	Tracking code injects properly
Part 2: Publishing Your App (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Test Everything First
Before publishing, make sure:

✅ Website loads and displays vehicles
✅ Chat widget works
✅ Login/authentication works
✅ SuperAdmin dashboard works
✅ API keys can be saved in Integrations tab
Step 2: Publish
In Replit, click the "Publish" button (top right)
Choose deployment type:
Autoscale (recommended) - scales with traffic, pay for what you use
Reserved VM - always-on, fixed monthly cost
Click "Publish"
Wait for deployment (usually 1-3 minutes)
You'll get a URL like: https://your-app-name.replit.app
Step 3: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)
After publishing, go to Deployments tab
Click "Add Custom Domain"
Enter your domain (e.g., inventory.olympicautogroup.ca)
Add the DNS records shown to your domain registrar
Wait for SSL certificate (automatic, ~15 min)
Part 3: Updating Your App (Without Losing Data)
What DOES Persist (Safe)
✅ PostgreSQL Database - All your data (vehicles, users, settings, API keys)
✅ Secrets - All environment variables/secrets
✅ Database schema changes - New tables/columns are applied automatically
What DOES NOT Persist (Lost on Republish)
❌ Files saved to filesystem (use database or object storage instead)
❌ In-memory data
❌ Temporary files
How to Update After Publishing
Simple Updates (code changes):

Make your changes in the Replit workspace
Test in development mode
Click "Publish" again
Changes go live in 1-3 minutes
Your database data is preserved!
Database Schema Changes:

Update your schema in shared/schema.ts
Run npx drizzle-kit push to apply to dev database
Test in development
When you publish, schema changes apply to production automatically
Rollback If Something Goes Wrong
Click the Checkpoints icon in Replit
Find a previous working checkpoint
Click "Restore"
Choose whether to restore:
✅ Code only
✅ Code + Database (be careful - this reverts data too!)
Part 4: Best Practices for Future Development
Adding New Features Safely
Always work in development first - Your dev environment is separate from production
Test thoroughly before publishing
Make database changes incrementally - Add columns as nullable first, then backfill data
Use the Checkpoints - Replit creates automatic checkpoints you can restore
Version Control Strategy
Replit automatically:

Creates checkpoints during development
Preserves your production database separately
Lets you restore code without affecting data
Adding More Dealerships
Go to SuperAdmin Dashboard
Click "Add Dealership"
Fill in details
Create a Master user for that dealership
Configure their API keys in Integrations tab
