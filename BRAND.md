# LotView Brand Guidelines

## Brand Personality
Sharp, efficient, dealer-tough. LotView is the tool that makes dealers say "finally, something built for us." Not flashy — functional. Not trendy — reliable.

## Voice & Tone
- Direct and confident. No filler words.
- Uses dealer terminology naturally: "units," "lot," "turn rate," "days on lot," "grossing," "pencil deal"
- Results-first: lead with numbers, back up with features
- Respects the dealer's time — get to the point fast
- Professional but not corporate. Think trusted vendor, not enterprise sales rep.

## Visual Identity
- Color palette: professional, automotive-inspired
  - Primary: deep blue (#1A365D)
  - Secondary: steel gray (#4A5568)
  - Accent: success green (#38A169) for positive metrics
  - Warning: amber (#D69E2E) for attention items
  - Danger: red (#E53E3E) for pricing alerts
  - Background: white (#FFFFFF)
  - Text: near-black (#1A202C)
- Typography: clean sans-serif (Inter, or system fonts for performance)
- UI style: data-dense dashboards, minimal chrome, maximum information
- Tables and data grids are first-class UI elements
- Charts: simple, clear, no 3D effects or unnecessary decoration

## Logo
- Not yet designed
- Direction: clean wordmark, possibly with a subtle vehicle/lot icon element
- Must look professional on a dealer's website

## Don'ts
- Never use Silicon Valley jargon ("disrupt," "synergy," "leverage")
- Never use bright/playful colors that feel consumer-grade
- Never sacrifice data density for aesthetics
- Never require more than 2 clicks to reach any critical function
- Never make the dealer feel like they're using a toy
